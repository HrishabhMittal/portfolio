        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            From an early age, I found myself captivated by the world of programming. In 7th grade, I first encountered programming through Visual Basic, sparking my interest in coding as a way to solve problems and create something new. In 8th grade, I began diving deeper, learning the basics of VB.NET and Java, and soon developed a fascination with game development.
            <br><br>
            By 10th grade, I started exploring Unity to understand game design principles and began learning JavaScript, which became my primary language for nearly two years. Using JavaScript's canvas element, I created my own games and grew more confident in coding for interactive applications. In 11th and 12th grades, I learned Python basics in school, which led me to study C++—a language that quickly became a favorite, alongside some work in C. Recently I have started to enjoy programming in Golang.
            <br><br>
            My journey took a deeper turn into understanding computer systems with x86 assembly (16- and 32-bit) and later, into scripting with Bash as I started college. Through each language I’ve learned, I've explored a variety of domains, including game development fundamentals, web development, low-level graphics programming in OpenGL, and data structures and algorithms.<br><br>
            Much of my understanding of algorithms and low-level concepts—like memory management, OS structures, and rendering—has come from extensive exploration on platforms like <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/Hrishabh_Mittal/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>, reading documentations, and hands-on projects. Currently, my primary interest is in understanding the inner workings of operating systems, and I’m excited to continue learning and contributing in this field. I have also started to explore the field of Cybersecurity by solving easy and medium capture the flags with picoCTF.
